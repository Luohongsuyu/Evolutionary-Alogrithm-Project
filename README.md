## Evolutionary Alogrithm Project

This GitHub repo contains all the content related to evolutionary algorithms that I learned under the guidance of Professor Hod Lipson, mainly including symbolic regression and evolutionary robotics.

## Evolutionary robotics
In the evolutionary robotics project, we aim to use evolutionary algorithms to design a robot made of mass and springs. The robot evolves by combining different structures and varying the extension cycles of the springs. The goal is to find a robot that can move in a specified direction.

The following images show the results of the evolution.
